# RNN-Based Text Generation Project

## Introduction

In this project, we implement a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate text that mimics the style of a given dataset. RNNs are particularly well-suited for sequence prediction tasks, such as text generation, due to their ability to maintain a memory of previous inputs.
How RNN Works

### Implementation Details

The implementation involves several key steps:

    Data Preparation:
        Tokenizing the text and creating a mapping from characters to indices.
        Creating sequences of fixed length to feed into the RNN.

    Model Architecture:
        Using an RNN layer (or LSTM/GRU for more complex patterns) to capture the sequential dependencies.
        Adding a Dense layer to predict the next character in the sequence.

    Training the Model:
        Defining the loss function (categorical_crossentropy) and optimizer (RMSprop).
        Training the model on the sequences to minimize the loss and improve text generation accuracy.

    Generating Text:
        Using the trained model to generate new text by predicting one character at a time, feeding the predicted character back into the model to generate the next one.
